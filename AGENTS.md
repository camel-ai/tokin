# tokin

A gateway that sits between an agent harness and an inference server: the harness
speaks text over `/v1/chat/completions`, the server only ever receives token ids.

## Commands

```bash
uv sync                       # install, including dev tooling
uv run pytest tests -q        # tests
uv run ruff check .           # lint
uv run ruff format .          # format
uv run mypy src               # types
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

`pre-commit` runs mypy and the fast tests through the project venv, so `uv sync`
has to have run first.

## Style

Formatting is `ruff`'s job. What a linter can't check:

### Files

No license or copyright headers — the licence lives at the repo root.

No module or package docstrings. A file starts at its first import or definition;
`D100` and `D104` are unselected for that reason.

### Docstrings

Document what the signature can't say. Types are in the signature already.

Three tiers, most code being the first:

- **None.** The name and types are enough. `def token_ids(self) -> list[int]`
  needs nothing.
- **One line.** There is a constraint or consequence a caller must know:
  `"""Append tokens the model sampled; must follow at least one prompt turn."""`
- **A short paragraph**, only when a design choice would otherwise look arbitrary
  and someone might reasonably undo it.

No `Args:` / `Returns:` sections to restate types — the signature carries them and
we don't generate API docs from docstrings. Use one only when two or more
parameters each carry a constraint the signature can't say; a single such
parameter goes in the one-line form. Don't restate the function name.

Roughly half the functions in a mature codebase carry no docstring at all, and
that is the target rather than a gap. `D1` stays unselected.

### Comments

A comment states the non-obvious reason at the boundary that owns it. One
sentence. Add a constraint or an expiry condition only when a maintainer needs it
to judge when the reason stops holding.

Never restate the operation, preserve an intermediate attempt, or list
speculative future work.

Behaviour goes in code; durable contracts go in the doc that owns them. If an
explanation runs to a paragraph, it is either describing what the code already
says — delete it — or it is a contract, and belongs here or in the commit
message.

### Private helpers

Extract a helper because the logic has a *name*, not because it repeats.
Repetition is usually better removed with a parameter or a loop; a helper earns
its place by naming a concept.

Three thresholds:

- **Under four lines: inline it.** A helper that short is almost unheard of in
  code that has been maintained; the indirection costs more than it saves.
- **Called once: the name has to say something concrete.** Single-use helpers are
  normal, so call count is not the test — nameability is. If the best name
  available is `_add` or `_process`, there is no concept to extract.
- **Keep private under ~20% of the functions in a module.** Past that a function
  is being sliced up rather than having concepts lifted out of it.

Eight to fifteen lines is the size at which naming something starts to pay.

When a helper does survive, define it before its callers so reading top to bottom
never requires jumping ahead.

### Module-level private functions

**Default is zero per file.** Adding one means arguing why it belongs to neither a
class nor its single caller. A module-level `_helper` has no owner, which is why
these accumulate: anyone can add one and nothing says what it pairs with.

Where they actually belong:

- Used by one class → make it a method on that class.
- Used once inside one function → inline it, or nest it in that function.
- A genuinely general pure function used from several places → it is probably
  public, or it belongs in its own module.

Module-level private *constants* (`_HEADERS = (...)`) are exempt — constants
belong at module scope.

The two numbers move together: files that accumulate module-level privates are
also the ones where private share creeps past half.

### Prose

Single backticks around identifiers and endpoints: `input_ids`, not
``input_ids``. Applies to docstrings, comments, and Markdown.

## Families

A family is one chat template lineage: a `ChatTemplate` subclass under
`src/tokin/chat_templates/` stating its facts as class attributes, with `models` the
checkpoints it was verified against.

A family is named for the generation that introduced its template; later
generations that keep it are appended to `models`, so `qwen35` covers Qwen3.6
and Qwen3.8 the way `llama3` covers 3.3 everywhere. A generation that changes
the template gets a new family, whatever it changed. Names describe the start of
a lineage, not a property of it, so they don't go stale.

`models` lists the mainline of a vendor completely, base and instruct alike;
special-purpose variants (Coder, VL, Math, QwQ, …) are left out until someone
needs them and then get a family of their own.

## Tests

Every test answers one question from a fixed list; a test with no question is
not written:

- **Declarations** — a family's stated facts hold against the real tokenizer.
- **Behaviour** — one contract per method, on a fake tokenizer.
- **Properties** — invariants across methods on real tokenizers. The one that
  matters most: the increment's ids are a suffix of the full render's ids.
- **Refusals** — one input per error contract, asserting the exception and its
  message.

Layout follows what a test needs, and only that decides whether it runs by
default:

- `tests/*.py` needs nothing and runs on every commit. The file name is the
  module under test.
- `tests/tokenizers/` needs real tokenizers (network once, then the cache); its
  `conftest.py` marks everything there `tokenizer`.
- `tests/integration/` needs a running inference server; marked `integration`,
  run by hand.

`addopts` skips the last two. The same module at another layer keeps its file
name and changes directory.

Default to module-level test functions, no class grouping — the name carries the
context.

Group into a class only when one function has three or more scenarios worth
covering. Then the class is named for the function under test
(`TestAddResponse`), and the methods name only the scenario — don't repeat the
function name in both. Grouped method names should read short, three or four
words, because the class already said what is being tested.

No docstrings on tests; the name is the documentation. If a case needs
justification, a one-line comment above the assertion.

## Commits

Conventional Commits, enforced by a `commit-msg` hook: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`,
`style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`.

`main` takes pull requests only, squash-merged, with `ci-ok` green.
